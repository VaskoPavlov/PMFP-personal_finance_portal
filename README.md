## Project Idea: “Personal Finance Management Portal”

To showcase my alignment with TBI Bank’s technical requirements—and to make my application stand out—I propose building a “Personal Finance Management Portal”. This prototype demonstrates end-to-end fintech capabilities using JavaScript, .NET, HTML/CSS, jQuery/AJAX, and a relational database, while also highlighting my banking domain knowledge. Below is a structured plan:
1. Project Overview & Goals

    * Account Overview: Authenticated users see all their virtual “bank” accounts (Checking, Savings, Credit).

    * Transaction History: Users can filter and search transactions by date range, amount, or description.

    * Internal Transfers: Permits moving funds between user accounts.

    * Expense Categorization: Allows tagging transactions as “Groceries,” “Utilities,” “Entertainment,” etc., to generate monthly spending reports.

    * Budget Dashboard: Visual summary of monthly income vs. expenses, using interactive charts.

    * Secure Authentication & Authorization: Role-based access: “Customer” vs. “Admin.”
